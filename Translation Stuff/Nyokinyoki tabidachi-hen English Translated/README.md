# Nyokinyoki tabidachi-hen English Translated
## WARNING
This is UNFINISHED, meaning not everything is translated.

## What is this?
This game is like the puyopuyo series, but a bit different as you choose when to pop them.

### Stuff Translated:
- Main Menu
- Free Mode menu and sub-menus
- Idk how to call it, but the area where you play, and Pause Menu

### Stuff half-translated:
- Local Play (Some errors and messages aren't translated)
- Score Attack (Only ranks aren't translated)

### Stuff untranslated:
- Story Mode (Will never be translated as I don't speak Japanese.)
- Tutorial (Might be Translated)

## Changelog:
### v0.1:
- Initial release
### v0.2:
- Translated main menu buttons (it's not perfect and I'm not doing it again, too much pain)
