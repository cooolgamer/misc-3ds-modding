# misc-3ds-modding
Here is my other 3ds mods that doesn't really require a repository just for them.

## Ok, that's cool, but how do I install them?
- First, be sure that your 3ds is modded, if not, then follow this [guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/),
- Enable game patching in luma config (hold select while booting),
- Download the mod you like, extract it, and simply copy/paste the "luma" folder on the root of your sdcard.
- Enjoy of course ;)
